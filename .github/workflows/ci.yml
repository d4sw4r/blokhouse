      # Step 1: Check out the repository
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v6

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js 24.x and cache npm dependencies
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v6
        with:
          node-version: "24"

      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      # Use `npm install` instead of `npm ci` so that Renovate PRs with
      # updated package.json (but stale lockfile) don't fail at this step.
      # The lockfile is regenerated in-place if it is out of sync.
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
