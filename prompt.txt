you are my nextjs developer expert and help me to create me a CMDB application. For now I have created a new nextjs project with the command "npx create-next-app@latest next-blokhouse" and changed nothing. I want to use "prisma" as database backend with sqlite and have user authentication with authjs. The Application should have a minimal tailwindcss frontend with shadcn components. I want to be able to store configuration items in the database with crud operations and have a restfull api to access them and the ui for humans. Ask if anything is not clear or you need further advice. Give me all Files I need to change or add to the project.
